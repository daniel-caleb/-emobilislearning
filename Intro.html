<center><b><u>Our Mission</u></b></center>
<p>The mission of eMobilis is to create opportunities for African youth by training them on digital, software and other
    technologies that prepare them for the future of work by equipping them with marketable, industry driven skills.
    <br>
    Our goal is to ensure that our talented youth are available and trained in order to meet the growing opportunities
    and needs of the ICT Industry in Africa.
    <br>
    We also envision an explosion of technology innovation and the creation of successful tech ventures by local
    developers from across the country with a zeal for changing the world through harnessing the power of their
    technology training for social good.</p>
<br>
<center><b><u>Our Vision</u></b></center>
<p>Our vision is to empower local youth to tap into the myriad opportunities that the mobile, technology and software
    development industry offers so that they can innovate, create and improve their situation in life through use of
    digital tools.
    <br>
    Given predictions that the digital economy will continue to grow exponentially throughout Africa, we are a catalyst
    to enable Africans from all walks of life to benefit from this social/economic revolutionâ€”not just in greater access
    of information, but also in leading design and content development. We hope our efforts will stimulate economic
    growth and empower African youth.</p>
